A very common component needed for an app is a simple yet powerful color picker.

Android unfortunately doesn‚Äôt offer one out of the box and that‚Äôs why I made my own.
It‚Äôs implemented with a simple `AlertDialog` and it allows both some pre-made options and the input from the user via hex values.

> This obviously isn‚Äôt the most user friendly design, but it‚Äôs great for a user base of developers or designers.

## The code
<script src="https://gist.github.com/Giuliopime/2739a199a51e9f8531aa2ab172fdb868.js"></script>

The picker receives:
- an initial color to display
- a list of colors (strings in the hex format) that renders and displays to the user
- a function which will be called when a **valid** color gets choosen by the user

It requires some utility functions too: some simple ones that transform strings to color objects and a trickier one, the `Color.contrastColor()` which, based on a given color, determines if a text placed above it should be White or Black.
